# Android Debug Bridge (adb) 

It is a versatile command-line tool that lets you communicate with a device. The adb command facilitates a variety of device actions, such as installing and debugging apps etc. adb is included in the Android SDK Platform-Tools package. It is a client-server program that includes three components: 

    A client, which sends commands. The client runs on your development machine. You can invoke a client from a command-line terminal by issuing an adb command.
    
    A daemon (adbd), which runs commands on a device. The daemon runs as a background process on each device.

    A server, which manages communication between the client and the daemon. The server runs as a background process on your development machine.

When client starts an adb, the client first checks whether there is an adb server process already running. If there isn't, it starts the server process. When the server starts, it binds to local TCP port 5037 and listens for commands sent from adb clients all adb clients use port 5037 to communicate with the adb server. The server then sets up connections to all running devices.
