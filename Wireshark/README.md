# Wireshark

#### Wireshark (formerly ethereal) is a network traffic analyser utility. 
It provides various facilities to see the flow of network data from one machine to another. Wireshark provides numerous ways to filter intended data packets and traffic. Wireshark displays the packet data with details like source, time, destination, protocol name and other relevant information. Each packet can be further analysed for its contents. 

#### The “Open Capture File” dialog box allows you to search for a capture file containing previously captured packets for display in Wireshark. 

## Wireshark intercepts traffic and converts that binary traffic into human-readable format. 

This makes it easy to identify what traffic is crossing your network, how much of it, how frequently, how much latency there is between certain hops, and so forth. A network packet analyzer will try to capture network packets and tries to display that packet data as detailed as possible. Our Network Protocol is broken down into 7-layers. The part that WireShark deals with is layer 2 up to 7. Most well known protocols can be decoded by WireShark.

#### Purposes of Wireshark:-
   
    - Network administrators use it to troubleshoot network problems
    
    - Network security engineers use it to examine security problems
    
    - Developers use it to debug protocol implementations
    
    - People use it to learn network protocol internals
